Just an aside, but I notice that the Witch uses both custom errors and `require` . Is there a philosophy there? Perhaps custom errors for parameterized errors, and `require` for everything else?


[07/15/2022 5:19 AM] devtooligan
not intentional afaik, we are experimenting with custom errors but haven't changed over completely

thankyou

ilkId - why is it named so? i wonder what "ilk" stands for...


[07/15/2022 12:44 PM] alcueca
Same as in MakerDAO, an `ilk` is a collateral. `ilkId` is the bytes6 identifier for the `ilk`


[07/15/2022 12:45 PM] alcueca
The Witch belongs in this repo, which you might find useful for context:
https://github.com/yieldprotocol/vault-v2


[07/15/2022 3:32 PM] hansfriese
I sent a DM


[07/15/2022 4:40 PM] alcueca

All, please be aware that all the other contracts in the Yield Protocol that the Witch integrates with are at https://github.com/yieldprotocol/vault-v2, and they are out of scope


[07/16/2022 5:07 AM] alcueca
And the docs for the wider protocol are at docs.yieldprotocol.com
